# Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n

>>> def fib(n):
>>>     a, b = 0, 1
>>>     while a < n:
>>>         print(a, end=' ')
>>>         a, b = b, a+b
>>>     print()
>>> fib(1000)

Functions Defined


The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists.

# Python 3: List comprehensions

>>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
>>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
>>> print(loud_fruits)

['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']



# List and the enumerate function

>>> list(enumerate(fruits))

[(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]


Compound Data Types


Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions.

Intuitive Interpretation


Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators 
+
, 
-
, 
*
 and 
/
 work as expected; parentheses 
()
 can be used for grouping.

# Python 3: Simple output (with Unicode)

>>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")

Hello, I'm Python!



# Input, assignment

>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
>>> print('Hi, %s.' % name)

What is your name?
Python
Hi, Python.


Quick & Easy to Learn


Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation structure easy to learn. 
Whet your appetite
 with our Python 3 overview.








# For loop on a list

>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
>>> product = 1
>>> for number in numbers:
...    product = product * number
... 
>>> print('The product is:', product)

The product is: 384


All the Flow You’d Expect


Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — 
if
, 
for
, 
while
 and 
range
 — with some of its own twists, of course.
