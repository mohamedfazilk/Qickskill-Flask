How long does it take to complete the Python for Everybody Specialization?
Time to completion can vary based on your schedule and experience level, but most learners are able to complete the Specialization in about 8 months.
How often is each course in the Specialization offered?
Each course in the Specialization is offered on a regular schedule, with sessions starting about once per month. If you don't complete a course on the first try, you can easily transfer to the next session, and your completed work and grades will carry over.  The Capstone Project will be offered three times per year.
What background knowledge is necessary?
This Specialization is designed to serve as an on-ramp for programming, and has no pre-requisites.  The pace of the first two courses is aimed at those with no programming experience at all.
What are the payment options?
You can pay for the entire Specialization upfront, or pay individually for each course as you progress. Financial aid is available for learners who qualify.
Do I need to take the courses in a specific order?
We recommend taking the courses in the order presented, as each subsequent course will build on material from previous courses.

Coursera courses and certificates don't carry university credit, though some universities may choose to accept Specialization Certificates for credit. Check with your institution to learn more.
What will I be able to do upon completing the Python for Everybody Specialization?
What if I already earned a Course Certificate in Programming for Everybody (Python)?
If you previously earned a verified Course Certificate for the Programming for Everybody (Python) course, you will automatically receive credit for completing courses 1 and 2 in the Specialization. You may begin with the third course of the Specialization, and you will receive a Specialization Certificate upon successful completion of courses 3 and 4 and the Capstone Project. However, if you earned an unverified Statement of Accomplishment, you will need to earn Course Certificates in all four courses, and successfully complete the Capstone Project.
